<img align="left" alt="CSS" width="50px" style="padding-right:10px;" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/css3/css3-plain-wordmark.svg" />

Optimization:

Definitely the code could be improve in redability. Some features could also be implemented such as the possibility of deleting a single URL rather than deleting the whole list. 
The user interface could also be improved with better design.

Lessons Learned:  

The concept that I have learnt and practice thanks to this project are:
-Appliecation of the JavaScript basic (variable, functions, Arrays, Loops)
-practiced the Document Object Model manipulation such as event listeners and the use of input values
-Inner HTML
-The use of Template literals to make code more readable and maintainable
-Save and remove from the local storage database using JSON Objects 
-Configuration of the app with the manifest.json file
